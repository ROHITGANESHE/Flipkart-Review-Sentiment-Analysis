# 📊 Flipkart Sentiment Analysis (ML)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of real-time Flipkart product reviews using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify customer reviews as **Positive** or **Negative** and deploy the trained model as a web application using **Streamlit**, hosted on **AWS EC2**.

This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship with GenAI** at **Innomatics Research Labs**.

## 🎯 Objectives
* Analyze customer reviews to understand sentiment trends
* Preprocess and clean real-world textual data
* Train and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment classification
* Deploy the trained model as a real-time web application
* Host the application on AWS Cloud for public access

## 🧾 Dataset Information
* **Source:** Flipkart (provided by Data Engineering team)
* **Product:** YONEX MAVIS 350 Nylon Shuttle
* **Total Reviews:** 8,518
* **Key Features:**
   * Reviewer Name
   * Review Text
   * Ratings
   * Up Votes / Down Votes
   * Review Date & Location

## ⚙️ Tech Stack Used
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK
* **Text Representation:** TF-IDF
* **Model:** Machine Learning Classifier
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **Cloud Platform:** AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)

## 🧠 Project Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Text Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
4. Model Training & Evaluation (F1-Score)
5. Streamlit App Development
6. Model Deployment on AWS EC2
7. Testing & Monitoring
